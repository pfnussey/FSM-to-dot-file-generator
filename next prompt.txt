First
Make an update to the main program window to replace the version text ("v2.0") with the following 2-line block: line 1: "Author: Peter Nussey", line 2: "ver2.0, 20/02/2026". 

Second
Add an "About" button with the following text.
This utility program has been written to assist the user in developing Finite State Machine (FSM) definitions for Node-Red by providing a conversion between the raw JSON format used by Node-Red and a graphical state diagram representation generated from Graphviz. The FSM to DOT File Generator takes as input a JSON file which defines the FSM and converts it to a .dot file which can be used by Graphviz to draw a state diagram of the FSM.
A typical workflow incorporating this tool is shown below:
1. Write a JSON file to describe the desired FSM.
2. Use the FSM to DOT File Generator to convert this file to a Grapviz .dot file.
3. Run the dot command from Graphviz with the generated .dot file as input to generate a PDF representation of the FSM state diagram.
4. Test the FSM and refer to the state diagram to assist with further development and debugging of the FSM.
5. Update the JSON file as required.
6. Repeat steps 2 - 5 until a satisfactory FSM has been developed. 

Third
I want to document the code properly. I have used Dowygen for c++. Would Doxygen be a suitable tool for this job? If not please suggest the right tool.

Fourth
Please comment the code for automatic documentation generation.
